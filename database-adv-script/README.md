# Advanced Database Scripts – Airbnb Clone

This directory contains **advanced SQL scripts and performance reports** developed for the **Airbnb Clone database**.  
The scripts demonstrate complex queries, performance optimization, and monitoring techniques.

- **Description:**
  - Aggregation queries using `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`.
  - Ranking queries using `ROW_NUMBER` and `RANK` window functions.

---

### 3️ Index Performance

- **File:** `index_performance.md`
- **Description:**
  - Identifies high-usage columns for indexing.
  - Shows query performance **before and after indexes**.

---

### 4️ Query Optimization

- **Files:**
  - `perfomance.sql` → Original and optimized queries for bookings with users, properties, and payments.
  - `optimization_report.md` → Analysis of inefficiencies and improvements.

---

### 5️ Table Partitioning

- **Files:**
  - `partitioning.sql` → Implements partitioning of the `bookings` table by `start_date`.
  - `partition_performance.md` → Performance improvements after partitioning.

---

### 6️ Performance Monitoring

- **File:** `performance_monitoring.md`
- **Description:**
  - Used `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to monitor frequently used queries.
  - Suggested schema adjustments (indexes, composite indexes, partitioning).
  - Reported execution time improvements.
