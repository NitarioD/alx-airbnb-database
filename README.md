## Importance of identifying design properties of a mock up design.

Identifying the design properties of a mockup design is crucial because it helps ensure that the final product meets user needs and project goals. Here’s why it’s important:

- Clarity and Communication: Clearly defined design properties (such as color schemes, typography, spacing, and layout) make it easier for designers, developers, and stakeholders to communicate and understand the intended look and feel of the product.

- Consistency: Documenting design properties ensures consistency across different screens and components, leading to a cohesive user experience.

- Efficient Development: When design properties are well-identified, developers can implement the design more accurately and efficiently, reducing misunderstandings and rework.

- Feedback and Iteration: Explicit design properties make it easier to gather feedback from stakeholders and users, allowing for targeted improvements before development begins.

- Accessibility and Usability: Considering properties like contrast, font size, and spacing early helps address accessibility and usability concerns from the start.

- Payments.

# Feature Breakdown

## API Documentation

- OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
- Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
- GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

## User Authentication

- Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
- Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

## Property Management

- Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
- Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

## Booking System

- Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
- Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

## Payment Processing

- Endpoints: /payments/
- Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

## Review System

- Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
- Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.

# Database Optimizations

- Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
- Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

# API Security

- Authentication: JWT (access + refresh); optional OAuth (Google/Apple). Passwords hashed with Argon2 or bcrypt.
- Authorization: Role‑based access control (RBAC) and object‑level permissions (hosts can only mutate their listings; guests only their bookings, etc.).
- Input Validation: Serializer/schema validation; length/type checks; strict file upload limits.
- Rate Limiting: DRF throttling and/or API gateway/NGINX limits (IP + user‑key).
- Transport Security: HTTPS everywhere; HSTS; secure cookies for session‑based flows.
- Secret Management: Environment variables, rotation, and minimal scope tokens.
- Payment Safety: Idempotency keys; webhook signature verification; PCI‑aware provider delegation (no raw PAN storage).
- Audit & Monitoring: Structured logs, trace IDs, admin audit trail, anomaly alerts.
- CORS/CSRF: Tight CORS; CSRF protection for session flows (if used).

# CI/CD Pipeline

- CI: On PRs → run linters, type checks, unit/integration tests; build Docker image; generate OpenAPI schema; upload coverage.
- CD: On main tag → push image; run DB migrations; deploy to env (staging → prod) with health checks and blue/green/rolling strategy.
- Tools: GitHub Actions, Docker, docker‑compose, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery worker, and a target (Render/Heroku/Fly.io/ECS/Kubernetes).
- Quality Gates: Required status checks; automated security scans (pip‑audit, trivy), secret scanners, and dependency pinning.
