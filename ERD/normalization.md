# Database Normalization Analysis

## Current State

The database schema is already well-structured but can be improved to fully comply with Third Normal Form (3NF).

## Normalization Steps

### First Normal Form (1NF)

- All tables already satisfy 1NF:
  - Each table has a primary key
  - All columns contain atomic values
  - No repeating groups

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

- Current schema satisfies 2NF:
  - All tables are in 1NF
  - All non-key attributes are fully dependent on their primary keys

### Third Normal Form (3NF)

No identified potential transitive dependencies

All tables remain unchanged as they already satisfy 3NF requirements.
